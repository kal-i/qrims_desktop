# QR Code Inventory Management and Item Tracking System - Desktop Application

## **Overview**

The `desktop app` serves as the central system for managing inventory, purchase requests, and issuances, while also generating reports for the supply office. 

---

## **Features**

- **Dashboard**: Overview of inventory and requests summary.  
- **Inventory Management**: Register `supply` (consumables) and `inventory` (often issued or tracked manually, containing different properties e.g., serial no. for simplified tracking and management) items, generate QR codes, update item details, and view records.  
- **Purchase Request Management**: Track officers' requests, validate issuance by comparing items to be issued with the requested item, and streamline report generation by extracting information from purchase requests.  
- **Item Issuance Management**: View and initiate item issuances, and generate issuance reports like `ICS` (Inventory Custodian Slip (items below Php 50,000.00)), `PAR` (Property Acknowledgement Receipt (items above Php 50,000.00)), `RIS` (supply items or consumables), stickers to be attached to the items, and inventory document reports: `Report on the Physical Count of Inventories`, `Report on the Physical Count of Semi-Expendable Property`, and `Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant, and Equipment`.  
- **Officer Management**: Manage officer records associated with purchase requests or item issuances.  
- **User Management**: Admin-specific tab that allows viewing desktop and mobile users, revoking user access, updating archive statuses, and approving pending mobile user requests.  
- **Archive Management**: Admin-specific tab to store and manage archived data securely.

   - Open the **Command Prompt** (press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter).
   - Run this command:  
     ```bash
     ipconfig
     ```
   - Look for **IPv4 Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.22`).

2. **Update `.env` File**  
   - Open the `.env` file in your project.
   - Add or update the following line with your IP address:
     ```dotenv
     IPv4_ADDRESS = '192.168.1.22'
     ```
   - Use this IP in your base URL:
     ```dotenv
     BASE_URL = 'http://${IPv4_ADDRESS}:your-port-here'
     ```

3. **Ensure Devices Are on the Same Network**  
   - Make sure your computer (server) and mobile device are connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**.

4. **Run the Server and Mobile App**
